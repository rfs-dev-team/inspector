# Inspector

The application is the successor to the fantastic [Inspeckage](https://github.com/ac-pm/Inspeckage), which in its time helped to study and identify many malicious applications and develop many Xposed modules.

This module is a "lite" version of its predecessor and is currently focused on the functional components, with further plans in the works:
- Expanding the possibilities and the number of hooks (not all of them are moved)
- Add the ability to send events to ELK (now logcat), and other cosmetic stuff
- etc
